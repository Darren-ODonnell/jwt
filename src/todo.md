    E7: java errors appear when database is not available - check availability and repond with message as necessary.
    Trued multiple methods but failed @EventListener, @PostConstruct @Bean etc 
    The problem centres around the HikariPool initilaisation. A manual way of loading the db may work better.

# In Progress    
    E1: Update and Edit do not work with React
        The default attribute used for all endpoints was @ModelAttribute - this is suitable for form-data and not JSON data/objects
        Changes to @RequestBody - this now works with add()
        Need to test with other methods in Competition - then replicate to other controllers.

       Relying upon circular references is discouraged and they are prohibited by default.
       Update your application to remove the dependency cycle between beans.
       As a last resort, it may be possible to break the cycle automatically by setting s to true.
